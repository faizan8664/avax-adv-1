## ERC20 Token and Vault System

This repository contains the codebase for an ERC20 token implementation and a secure vault system for managing and storing tokens. The ERC20 token standard is widely used for creating tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and the vault system provides a secure way to manage and store these tokens.

### Features

- **ERC20 Token Implementation**: The repository includes a smart contract implementation of the ERC20 token standard. This allows users to create, transfer, and manage tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Vault System**: The vault system provides a secure way to manage and store ERC20 tokens. Users can deposit tokens into the vault, withdraw tokens from the vault, and transfer tokens between vaults.

- **Security**: The smart contracts are designed with security in mind to protect against common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflows.

### Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the ERC20 token and vault system:

1. Deploy the ERC20 token contract.

2. Deploy the vault contract.

3. Mint some tokens using the ERC20 token contract.

4. Approve the vault contract to spend tokens on your behalf.

5. Deposit tokens into the vault.

6. Perform transactions such as transferring tokens between vaults or withdrawing tokens from the vault.
